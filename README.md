# Online marketing project
Investments in both paid and organic search are crucial for the today’s online retailer. In this project, it is analyzed how consumers respond to organic and paid search advertising and gain insight into the interrelationship between these online marketing channels. The interaction effects between paid and organic search and the conversion probability based on clickstream data are utilized by applying a binary logit model and Markov-Chain- Monte-Carlo techniques.
